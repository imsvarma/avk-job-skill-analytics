# 💼 AVK Job Skill Analytics

**AVK Job Skill Analytics** is an end-to-end data engineering and analytics project designed to extract, transform, and analyze job market data to uncover valuable insights about skills, salaries, companies, and trends.  
The project automates data flow from extraction to visualization using modern data engineering tools like **AWS**, **Airflow**, **SQL Server**, and **Power BI/Qlik**.

## 🚀 Project Overview
<img width="2281" height="1376" alt="Job Market Overview" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dab514e-0844-48d6-8f5b-3055ffa7111f" />


The goal of this project is to build a **fully automated ETL pipeline** that:
- Extracts raw job data from multiple public datasets (Kaggle, HuggingFace, etc.)
- Cleans and transforms the data for consistency and accuracy
- Loads processed data into **SQL Server**
- Delivers interactive visual dashboards for insights on job markets and skill trends

This project serves as a real-world demonstration of **Data Engineering**, **ETL automation**, and **BI Visualization** best practices.

## 🧱 Architecture

**Data Flow:**  
`Kaggle / HuggingFace → AWS S3 (Raw) → Transformation Scripts → S3 (Transformed) → SQL Server (EC2) → Power BI / Qlik Dashboards`

**Tools Used:**
- **AWS S3** – Data storage (raw & transformed layers)  
- **Apache Airflow** – Workflow orchestration and automation  
- **Python (Pandas, Boto3, SQLAlchemy)** – Extraction & transformation logic  
- **SQL Server (EC2 instance)** – Central analytical database  
- **Power BI / Qlik Sense** – Data visualization and reporting  
- **GitHub (CI/CD)** – Version control and collaboration

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/imsvarma/avk-job-skill-analytics.git
cd avk-job-skill-analytics
git checkout dev
```

### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # (Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Configure Environment Variables
Add your credentials in `.env` or environment variables:
```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
AWS_REGION=us-east-2
SQL_SERVER=your_server_ip
SQL_DB=job_skill_db
SQL_USER=sa
SQL_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### 4️⃣ Run Airflow
```bash
airflow db init
airflow webserver &
airflow scheduler &
```
The DAGs under `dags/` will handle:
- Extract → Transform → Load
- Auto-run daily or manually via the Airflow UI

## 🧩 ETL Pipeline Components

| Step | Description | Tools |
|------|--------------|-------|
| **Extract** | Fetches job data from Kaggle/HuggingFace and uploads it to S3 (`extract/raw/`). | Python, Boto3, AWS CLI |
| **Transform** | Cleans, standardizes, and enriches job titles, skills, and salary info. Stores outputs in `s3://job-skill-analytics/transformed/`. | Pandas, Regex, Python |
| **Load** | Loads transformed CSVs into SQL Server tables using `pyodbc`/`SQLAlchemy`. | Python, SQL Server |
| **Visualize** | Connects SQL tables to Power BI / Qlik dashboards for insights. | Power BI, Qlik |

## 📊 BI Dashboards

**Dashboards Include:**
- 📍 Job distribution by **location & country**
- 💰 Salary analysis across roles and companies
- 🧠 Top in-demand **technical & soft skills**
- 🏢 Company hiring trends
- 📈 Job postings and skill frequency trends over time

Each dashboard provides filters for **country, role, and date**, helping identify emerging market demands.

---
## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Integrate **real-time job feeds** using APIs (LinkedIn, Indeed)  
- Use **NLP / AI models** for smarter skill extraction  
- Add **data quality monitoring dashboards** in Airflow  
- Automate Power BI refresh via API  
- Deploy dashboards to **AWS QuickSight / Streamlit web app**

---

## 🧾 Example Output

- **ETL Logs:** `s3_transform_pipeline.log`  
- **Transformed Folder:** `s3://job-skill-analytics/transformed/`  
- **SQL Tables:** `job_data`, `job_skills`, `job_summary`  
- **Dashboards:** Power BI / Qlik visuals on job insights

---

## 🧠 Learnings & Highlights
